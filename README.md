# MIDTERM PROJECT
By Hadjie Alayan and Edward Sarte
## *Information  Gathering* 
 a systematic approach to collecting, organizing, and analyzing data that incorporates planning, quality control, and stakeholder involvement. 
 
 * Nmap    
 With Nmap, security professionals can find live hosts on a network and perform port scanning. This app is helpful for many reasons such as identifying open ports which are vulnerable to attack by hackers, or finding the operating system in use so that vulnerabilities may be exploited.

## *Vulnerability Analysis*
 A vulnerability assessment is the process of defining, identifying, classifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications and network infrastructures.

* Nikto  
is an Open Source software written in Perl language that is used to scan a web-server for vulnerability that can be exploited and can compromise the server. It can also check for outdated version details of 1200 servers and can detect problems with specific version details of over 200 servers. It comes packed with many features, a few of them are listed below.   [Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/GH9qn_DBzCk?si=qLlXfqlGgvi80J2N>)


## *Web Application Analysis*
an important part of securing your enterprise. By identifying vulnerability in software before it is deployed or purchased, Web application testing tools help ward off threats and the negative impact they can have on competitiveness and profits.

* Burp Suite  
is a software security application used for penetration testing of web applications. Both a free and a paid version of the software are available.

## *Database Assessment*
 is one of the most important phases of Hacking. It is done after Information Gathering and is one of the crucial steps to be done while designing an application. The cyber-world is filled with a lot of vulnerabilities which are the loopholes in a program through which hacker executes an attack. These vulnerabilities act as an injection point or a point that could be used by an attacker as a launchpad to execute the attack.

* SQLNinja 
is a specialized Perl-based tool that we used to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities on a web application that uses Microsoft SQL server as its backend. It allows remove access to the vulnerable Database server and is used to help automate the process of taking over a DB Server when a SQL injection vulnerability is discovered.

## *Password Attacks*
can be of two types. The first type is the dictionary attack, which uses a list of common words. It continues to run through the list until a suitable match is found. On the other hand, a brute-force attack uses words based on a given character set. With an online password attack, either one of the methods can be used.
 
* John the Ripper
can be used to crack passwords from text files and word lists, also known as password dictionaries. It's often one of the most important tools that anyone who wants to break into systems will need for performing password attacks.

## *Wireless Attacks*
involves identifying and examining the connections between all devices connected to the business's wifi. These devices include laptops, tablets, smartphones, and any other internet of things (IoT) devices. Common types of wireless attacks include: Data.

* Aircrack-ng 
 this is the most widely used wireless password cracking tool. Aircrack-ng is a wireless security framework with a suite of tools used to capture wireless traffic. It is used to crack and recover WEP/WPA/WPA2 keys. The suite of tools can be used to perform the following: monitoring (capturing of network traffic), attack (carry out de-authentication attacks and replay attacks), testing (testing of hardware wireless capabilities) and cracking (WEP, WPA and WPA2 pre-shared keys).

## *Reverse Engineering*
 a useful skill set for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity. On the attack side, the ability to analyze and understand how programs work is valuable for identifying new exploitable vulnerabilities.

* Apktool is a tool third party tool for reverse engineering that can decode resources to nearly original form and recreate them after making some adjustments. It allows debugging smali code step by step and also it allows working with app easier due to its project-like files structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. [Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/Ev4e8YguBz0?si=o0UY0K24WH62LuXT>)
   
## *Exploitation Tools*
is a screening tool to identify children/young people and adults up to the age of 25years at risk of/or that are being exploited.

* Metasploit
 Framework is basically a penetration testing tool that exploits the website and validates vulnerabilities. This tool contains the basic infrastructure, specific content, and tools necessary for penetration testing and vast security assessment. Metasploit Framework is one of the most famous exploitation frameworks and is updated on a regular basis. It can be accessed in the Kali Whisker Menu and launched directly from the terminal. Also here, new exploits are updated as soon as they are published. It contains many tools that are used for creating security workspaces for vulnerability testing and penetration testing systems. It was designed by rapid7 LLC and is completely open-source software and is easy to use. [Tutorial Video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QynUOJanNqo>)

## *Sniffing & Spoofing*
Sniffing network traffic can provide access to valuable intelligence, and spoofing traffic can enable a penetration tester to identify and exploit potential attack vectors. Kali Linux is an operating system built for penetration testers and includes a large library of built-in tools.

* Wireshark is one of the most well-known and commonly-used tools for sniffing and spoofing. Wireshark is a network traffic analysis tool with an extremely wide feature set.[Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/DCqbOhWSFus?si=Skh1cbgixqmPOcXk>)
  
## *Post Expliotation*
 refers to any actions taken after a session is opened. A session is an open shell from a successful exploit or bruteforce attack. A shell can be a standard shell or Meterpreter. To learn more about the difference between each, see Manage Meterpreter and Shell Sessions.

* Netcat this tool is great because it has many uses such as port listening, creating backdoor shells, port scanning and much more. Netcat can be used to set up port redirection which can help with client-server communication.  [Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/ERZNMZZ2Uy0?si=UfMCWAu65pzERdrt>)
  
## *Forensics*
 It is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. It extracts information without parsing file systems such as e-mail addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of details from digital evidence files.

* Binwalk is a great tool when we have a binary image and have to extract embedded files and executable codes out of them. It is even used to identify the files and codes which are embedded inside the firmware images. Binwalk is compatible with magic signatures for UNIX file utility as it uses libmagic library.[Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/kVeAXSS-H8U?si=go9h-IrRp8XrZvMD>)
  
## *Reporting Tools*
is one of the very important means in Ethical hacking or pen-testing, you must have heard the term called POC which is proof of concept. when a hacker or pen tester checks a system for loopholes or vulnerabilities then they need to provide an end report to the organization which consists of all the processes of discovering a vulnerability and also fixing it. 

* Dradis Reporting Tool It is a tool that helps in the process of penetration testing, which is all about information discovery, Exploiting useful information, and Reporting the findings. It is an open-source collaboration and reporting platform for IT security experts. this platform was developed in the Ruby programming language. this comes preinstalled with new versions of Kali Linux but you can install it manually also.[Tutorial Video](<https://youtu.be/tdvTRV1ejGo?si=APZRa4z-Z9GAtUK0>)
  
## *Social Engineering Tools*
 is the art of tricking people and making them share sensitive information voluntarily. It uses psychological manipulation to play with people’s trust so that they give up information like passwords, bank details and even their system’s credentials without suspicion. The most common attack vectors using social engineering are malicious emails and fake websites that solicit personal information by posing legitimate channels from a real organization.

* MSFvenom Payload Creator is a user-friendly tool that makes it easy to create basic payloads. It helps users avoid the need to write long msfvenom commands to generate payloads. With this generator, you can create payloads with a minimum of one argument.
